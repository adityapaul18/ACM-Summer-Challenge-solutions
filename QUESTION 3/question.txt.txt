Mike is at home for 3 months because of Corona Pandemic. He can't go outside his home because of lockdown. 
So he can play only indoor games. He plays exactly Ai hours on an ith day. Now, his college faculties decided 
to give assignments daily. It takes exactly Bi hours to complete assignments on an ith day. Mike can give at m
ost Ci hours on an ith day for playing and completing assignments. But on someday, he requires some more time.
 Find "The total extra time" he requires to play exactly Ai hours and to study exactly Bi hours for the total N days. 

INPUT:

The first line contains one integer t - the total number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the total number of days.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers Ai.
The third line of each test case contains N space-separated integers Bi.
The fourth line of each test case contains N space-separated integers Ci.

OUTPUT:

For each test case print one integer - The total extra time requires for N days in new line.

Constraints:

1 <= t <= 100
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Ai , Bi , Ci <= 1000


SAMPLE INPUT

1
5
1 3 2 2 5
2 1 7 4 2
5 2 2 6 8

SAMPLE OUTPUT

9
