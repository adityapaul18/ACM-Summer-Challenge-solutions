Recently, Barney found a box with digits, in his room.
There are A digits marked as ‘1’, B digits marked as ‘2’, C digits marked as ‘3’ and D digits marked as ‘4’.
Barney finds the Integers ‘12’ and ‘234’ as legendary integers.
He tries to make legendary integers from the given digits in the box. Help him maximize the number of legendary digits he can form.
Note that after you complete making legendary integers, you must make sure that the number of 1’s, 2’s, 3’s and 4’s are not used more than A, B, C, and D times respectively.



Input

The first line contains one integer t - number of test cases.
For each test case a single line containing Integers A, B, C and D.



Output

For each test case print a single Integer in a new line that denotes the maximum number of legendary integers formed by Barney.


Constraints

1 <= t <= 105
0 ≤ A, B, C, D ≤ 1018


SAMPLE INPUT

1
1 2 3 4


SAMPLE OUTPUT

2


Explanation

In the sample input given the maximum number of legendary numbers will be formed when one "234" and one "12" is obtained by using given digits hence the answer will be 2.
